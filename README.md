# Grackle DB
Unoptimized database written for fun and to learn Go.

It is extremely unlikely to be a wise choice for a database.

####Supports:
* Queries
  * select * from &lt;table&gt;
  * select &lt;column&gt; from &lt;table&gt;
  * select &lt;column1&gt;, &lt;column2&gt; from &lt;table&gt;

####Lacks:
* Persistent storage
* Most things you'd expect from a database
